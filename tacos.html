    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These are what I would consider to be the best "street-style" tacos you can make at home. They're quick and simple, 
        because they only require a few key ingredients. These tacos are perfect for cooking a meal for a large group of people.
        Everyone can grab a plate and a few taco shells and then pile on the ingredients!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Your choice of meat (beef, chicken, pork)</li>
        <li>Corn Tortillas</li>
        <li>White Onion</li>
        <li>Cilantro</li>
        <li>Taco Seasoning</li>
        <li>Limes</li>
        <Li>Cervesas</Li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Brown the meat and add seasoning while it cooks.</li>
        <li>While the meat is cooking, prep the onions and cilantro by cutting them both finely and placing them to the side.</li>
        <li>Once the meat is done cooking, cut/chop it into smaller pieces and warm the tortillas</li>
        <li>Serve the tacos with a beer of your choice. I'd go with a Modelo, but don't forget the lime!</li>
    </ol>
