    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Fresh vegetables? Quick and easy homemade broth? A soft-boiled egg and a pile of our favorite curly-cue packaged ramen noodles that remind us of college? Thatâ€™s this homemade ramen.
        
        On the flip side, this recipe leans more in the direction of I-have-a-package-of-ramen-and-some-vegetables-can-we-make-lunch practical. Sort of healthy and fast and a little nostalgic (packaged ramen!) but also fresh-ly delicious with a ton of flavor.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons grated ginger</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons grated garlic</li>
        <li>4 cups broth (I used chicken, but vegetable would also work)</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>1 ounce dried shiitake mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 packages instant ramen (noodles only!)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped scallions or chives</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped kale</li>
        <li>1 cups shredded carrots</li>
        <li>Sriracha to taste</li>
        <li>crunchy golden panko crumbs for topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet over medium low heat. Add the garlic and ginger; stir fry for 2 minutes or until soft and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the broth and the water. Bring to a simmer; add the mushrooms and simmer for 10 minutes or until the mushrooms have softened and the broth is flavorful.</li>
        <li>Add the instant noodles to the hot liquid and simmer for an additional 5 minutes or until the noodles have softened. Add the scallions and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, stir in the kale and carrots, and top with crunchy panko crumbs (see notes) and a soft-boiled egg (optional). Season with chili oil, hot sauce, sesame oil, and/or soy sauce and salt to taste.</li>
    </ol>
